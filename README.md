# My First Pong Game Python

Really simple pong game that i made using turtle in Python.

## Keybinds

### Player 1

`w` for up

`s` for down

### Player 2

`Up` for up

`Down` for down

Only one input at a time for now. Trying to think of how to make it accept and execute both player inputs at the same time. Might not even be possible with turtle tho.
